    ### Introduction

    Every year, students across the country take the ACT and SAT to compete to get into colleges around the world. However, ACT participation has been higher than SAT participation. In this deliverable, I will be trying to answer where college board's money should be spent to increase SAT participation.

    ### What I Learned    

    From the data, I looked at North Dakota, Kentucky, and Kansas. I chose these states because from each graph I created I noticed that there was an interesting trend. While ACT participation was high (close to 100%), SAT scores were quite high, while participation was low. I wanted to take a look into why this trend was happening, why were there even 2-4% of people taking the SAT when participation rates were so high? Is there a policy in these states making participation rates high? Or are students in these states just more likely to take the ACT over the SAT?   ,

    From outside research, I realized that there are 12 states that allow juniors in college to take the ACT for free. These states seem to correlate with those in my data with high participation rates, and apparently, high test scores in the SAT.   ,
      ,
    From this, I concluded that in states where neither test are free, students who have the resources to pay for the test are more likely take the test they are more confident that they will succeed in. (https://blog.collegevine.com/here-are-the-average-sat-scores-by-state/) Other blogs appear to support this initial conclusion.   ,
      ,
    However, when a test is free, high school students are more likely to take the test that does not provide any financial burden. However, the students who have the resources to pay for the SAT are probably very confident they will end up with a great score, skewing the results in that way. This hypothesis seems to be supported by the data, where there is a relationship with high ACT participation, low ACT scores, and yet high SAT scores.  ,
      ,
    My conclusion from this is that the college board should consider pitching to these same states, and more, to provde the SAT for free. This releases the financial burden on students and their families. Additionally, this creates more opportunities for low income families whos children may never have thought that applying to college was something they could afford (https://www.petersons.com/blog/the-act-test-as-a-standard-state-test/).   ,
      ,
    By eliminating barriers to college, more students will take the test, and students who believe they could perform better on the SAT over the ACT will take the SAT, and thus increase SAT participation.
